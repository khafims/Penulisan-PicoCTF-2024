Points: 450

## Category
Binary Exploitation

## Question
>It looks like Dr. Xernon added a stack canary to this [program](files/vuln) to protect against buffer overflows. Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag? You can find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-3_3_6bcc2aa22b2b7a4a7e3ca6b2e1194faf. [Source](files/vuln.c). 

### Hint
>Maybe there's a smart way to brute-force the canary?

## Solution
Unsolved.

### Flag
`flag`
