## Question
>Can you exploit the following [program](files/gets) to get a flag? You may need to think return-oriented if you want to program your way to the flag. You can find the program in /problems/can-you-gets-me_1_e66172cf5b6d25fffee62caf02c24c3d on the shell server. [Source](files/gets.c). 

### Hint
>This is a classic gets ROP

## Solution
First, find out the padding required for the buffer overflow. Then, use a rop chain to get the flag.

ROP chain generated by [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget).
