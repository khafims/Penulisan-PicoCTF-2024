# Solution

Use, `nc mimas.picoctf.net 55122`, to connect. Once connected it gives three options to choose from:

`Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe`

This is a format string challenge, `Gr%114d_Cheese`, is the only thing that has a format string (%11) in it. Next, these are the choices:

`Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak`

`Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` has %s in it so by choosing that it gives the flag.
