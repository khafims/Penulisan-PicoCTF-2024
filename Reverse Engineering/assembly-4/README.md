Reversing

## Question
>Can you find the flag using the following assembly [source](files/comp.nasm)? WARNING: It is VERY long... 

### Hint
>Hmm.. There must be an easier way than reversing the whole thing right?

## Solution
Compile the code using _nasm_ and _gcc_. Run executable and get the flag.

Note: The flag outputted is `picoCTF{1_h0p3_70u_c0mP1l3d_tH15_2390040222}`, however this doesn't work on the server. Refer to https://piazza.com/class/jkimphnvxey1qo?cid=65 to get the real flag

Working solution [solve.sh](solution/solve.sh)

### Flag
`picoCTF{1_h0p3_y0u_c0mP1l3d_tH15_2350040222}`
