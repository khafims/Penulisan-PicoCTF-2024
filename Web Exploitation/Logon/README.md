## Question
>I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:37861/)) 

### Hint
>Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for admins?
>
>How does check the admin's password?

## Solution
Using any password and username, you will be able to login, however, upon logon,you will be greeted by:

```
Success: You logged in! Not sure you'll be able to see the flag though.
No flag for you
```
Upon inspection of cookies, it can be seen that there exists a cookie names admin with theh value false
```
admins		False			2018shell1.picoctf.com	/	1969-12-31T23:59:59.000Z	10
password	password		2018shell1.picoctf.com	/	1969-12-31T23:59:59.000Z	20
username	username		2018shell1.picoctf.com	/	1969-12-31T23:59:59.000Z	20
```

Changing the value of admin to True will result in the printing of the flag.
