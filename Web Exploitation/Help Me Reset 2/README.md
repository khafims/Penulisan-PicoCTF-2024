## Question
>There is a website running at http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:19054 (link). We need to get into any user for a flag!

### Hint
>Try looking past the typical vulnerabilities. Think about possible programming mistakes.

## Solution
going to the site, upon inspection, we notice a comment stating
```
<!--Proudly maintained by lum-->
```
assuming that the user has an account, we can then attempt to rest the password. we will be asked a few questions, to find the answer, i just did a simple google search for the popular answers

```
What is your favourite car make
What is your favourite food?
What is your favourite color?         white
What is your favourite superhero?     thor
```

using that, we can gain access and change the password and proceed to login
