# Description

Do you know how to use the web inspector? <br>
Start searching here to find the flag

# Solution

By going to the given link with the web inspector the source code could be seen. In navigating the different pages you can see on the About page it says "Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there" and in the source code right above that header is a section with this attribute `notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9"`.

That line looks like something encoded (likely base64) so by putting the encoded text in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Magic(3,false,false,'')) with the Magic filter you can see that it is Base64 and it gives the flag.
