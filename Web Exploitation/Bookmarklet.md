# Description

Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet <br>
to print it for me? <br>
Browse here, and find the flag!

# Solution

When you go to the site JavaScript code is shown and displayed as a "bookmarklet for you to try". There are multiple ways to approach this.

A bookmarklet could be created by bookmarking/starring the page and then editing the bookmark to put the JavaScript code in place of the URL field. Then when loading the bookmark it will give you a pop-up with the flag. Note that in Chrome to edit the bookmark you have to click the bookmark to edit it and under "Folder" go to "Choose another folder..." to see these options. 

An [online compiler](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/) would achieve the same result when putting and running the javascript there.
