## Question
>There is a website running at http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:21579 ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:21579/)). Try to see if you can push their buttons. 

### Hint
>What's different about the two buttons?

## Solution
Follow the buttons and get Rick Roll'd!

In _boo.html_, looking at the source, we can see that _button2.php_ is expecting a POST request. As such, all we have to do is send a POST request and get the flag.

Working solution [solve.py](solution/solve.py)

### Flag
`picoCTF{button_button_whose_got_the_button_ed306c10}`
