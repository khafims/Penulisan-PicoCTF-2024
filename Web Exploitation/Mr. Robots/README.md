## Question
>Do you see the same things I see? The glimpses of the flag hidden away? ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:10157/))

### Hint
>What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution
going to the site, we will be able to see 

#### index.html
```
Mr. Robots
HELLO FRIEND
```
given the hints above, we visit /robots.txt to see if there any sites that the creator does not want us to know about

#### robots.txt

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /143ce.html
```
now we go to 143ce.html

#### 143ce.html
```
Mr. Robots
So much depends upon a red flag
picoCTF{th3_w0rld_1s_4_danger0us_pl4c3_3lli0t_143ce}
```

Working solution [solve.py](solution/solve.py)

### Flag
`picoCTF{th3_w0rld_1s_4_danger0us_pl4c3_3lli0t_143ce}`
